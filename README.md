# WeatherApp
Pick a city and you'll know the weather there
---------------------------------------------
My first app where i interacted with an API, precisely OpenWeather API, I learned how to fetch the data from the API and how to manipulate the DOM so that I can print it. I also used some more advanced CSS for the first time(some slide-in and grow-in animations).
